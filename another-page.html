    <div class="m-10 p-10">
        <!-- var description -->
        <h1 class="text-4xl bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-1/12 font-bold   mb-3" >var</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is
            called "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).
        </p>

        <!-- let description -->

        <h1 class="text-4xl mt-3 bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-1/12 font-bold   mb-3">let</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">The keyword let in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in
            JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any
            other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.</p>

        <!-- const description -->
        <h1 class="text-4xl  mt-3 bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-1/12 font-bold   mb-3">const</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">Const is another keyword to declare a variable when you do not want to change the value of
            that variable for the whole program. The difference is just that var is for normal variable declaration
            whose value can be changed, whereas a variable value declared using const keyword cannot be changed.</p>

        <!-- when to use null  -->
        <h1 class="text-3xl mt-3 bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-3/12 font-bold   mb-3">When to use null </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">Only use null if you explicitly want to denote the value of a variable as having "no value".
            As @com2gz states: null is used to define something programmatically empty. undefined is meant to say that
            the reference is not existing. A null value has a defined reference to "nothing".</p>

        <!-- when to use undefined -->

        <h1 class="text-3xl mt-3 bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-3/12 font-bold   mb-3">When to use undefined</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement
            also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function
            returns undefined if a value was not returned .</p>

        <!-- Rest API means -->
        <h1 class="text-3xl mt-3 bg-green-100 rounded-lg w-2/12 font-bold   mb-3">REST API</h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications
            or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
            principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
